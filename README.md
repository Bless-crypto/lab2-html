This project is a practical exercise aimed at creating a well-structured, responsive HTML5 webpage. It demonstrates the application of modern web standards and semantic HTML elements to build a clean and accessible page. The project is designed around key HTML5 concepts. These elements provide a clear and meaningful layout that improves both user experience and search engine optimization.
The webpage is built with responsiveness in mind, utilizing the viewport meta tag to ensure the page adapts smoothly to different screen sizes and devices, offering a consistent experience for users across mobile, tablet, and desktop views. A contact form is also included, using HTML5 form validation to ensure that required fields are filled out correctly before submission. The form is simple but functional, allowing users to submit their name, email, and a message.
Version control is an essential part of this project, managed through Git and hosted on GitHub. This allows for efficient tracking of changes, collaboration, and sharing of the project. The repository also serves as a platform for potential collaboration, where changes can be reviewed through pull requests. This project serves as an introduction to building accessible, structured, and maintainable web pages, while also learning key development workflows such as version control and deployment on GitHub.
